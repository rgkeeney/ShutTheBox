# ShutTheBox
my attempt at a game, with both a text and GUI version
GUI is not as nice as text version, but still works for me (I gave up on adding dice to the panel after the 5th fire alarm today)


The object of the game is to flip as many tiles down as possible
the game starts with two dice being rolled, you can flip down as many tiles as will add up to EXACTLY the same as the dice
so if the dice are 3 and 4, you can flip down a)7 b)2 and 5 c)3 and 4 d)1 and 6
after the 7, 8 and 9 tiles are flipped down, one die is rolled.
